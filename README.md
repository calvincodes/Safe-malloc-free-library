# A Safe malloc/free library
## Authors

* **Arpit Jain**
* **Anshu Verma**


A build tool to read, validate and execute make files.
Uses fork and execvp for creation of new processes and command execution.

## Task List

This project is divided in the following major modules.

* **malloc537**:
    * Reads the command line arguments if passed and parses them.
    * Reads the make file and parses to create a graph structure for all the targets which are to be executed.

* **free537**:
    * Traverses through the graph (assuming no cycles) in PostOrder manner.
    * Checks if a target requires rebuilt as per the modification time of all its dependencies.
    * Executes all the commands associated with a target if target building is required.

* **memcheck537**:
    * Traverses through the graph (assuming no cycles) in PostOrder manner.
    * Checks if a target requires rebuilt as per the modification time of all its dependencies.
    * Executes all the commands associated with a target if target building is required.

* **Files**:
    * TreeNode.c:
        * It defines all the target node in the makeFile. All the dependencies and command associates are part of this structure.
        * It also provides following functionality.
        * This also lets you create all the connections among graph Node.
        * It also has cycle detection method

    * linkedList:
        * It defines the list of dependencies associated with TargetNode.
        * All the commands node are also modeled as linkedList

    * struct_input:
        * This input structure stores the input commands like target or makefile provided in the command line.

* **Utils**:
    * Constants used across the program.
    * Validator used across the program.

* **driver.c** is the driver module for the entire project.
